# Notes API .NET Core

This is a copy of [NotesAPI](https://github.com/NeedsSoySauce/NotesAPI) written in ASP.NET Core (both of these projects were made to introduce me to their respective frameworks/etc). Like NotesAPI, SwaggerUI is included for testing and documentation.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo and run `dotnet restore`
2. To setup your MySQL database you can use the query provided in `create_database.sql`
3. Update the connection string for `MySQL` in `appsettings.json`
